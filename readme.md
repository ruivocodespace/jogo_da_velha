## 🚀 How it Works
- The board is represented by a list of 9 positions (`0 to 8`).  
- **Player 1** chooses between **X** or **O** at the beginning.  
- Players take turns making their moves, selecting the position where they want to play.  
- The game ends when:  
  - A player wins.  
  - All positions are filled with no winner (**draw** / "cat’s game").

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple files for better organization:  

- `main.py` → Main game code.  
- `check_winf.py` → Function that checks if there is a winner or a draw.  
- `check_impf.py` → Function that validates if a move is valid (position is free and allowed).  
- `print_tabf.py` → Function that prints the game board in the terminal.
